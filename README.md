### Idhany RPG ###

Idhany is an RPG game that's nowhere near finished. Pretty much everything was made by me,  
using Pygame. It does come with a .EXE file so you don't have to download Python, but if you would  
like to use mods/anything that doesn't come with the base game, you have to download Python (and   probably have a bit of Python experience). Now, I'm not a great programmer, (It took me three,  maybe four days of developing non-stop to get all this stuff working together) so you will  
definitely encounter bugs. If you do encounter some ultra rare edge cases, just submit a new issue  
(or wait for me to find it and fix it myself) and I'll probably fix it eventually.

The working .EXE file is in idhany/dist/game.

(feel free to make changes to the code, but don't compain to me when my janky code breaks!)

No website yet, but I might make a github pages thing eventually.
